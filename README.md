# BLS12_381 Public Key Generation using Lambda Works

This Rust program computes the public key from a given secret key on the BLS12_381 elliptic curve. It uses elliptic curve multiplication of the secret key with the generator point to derive the public key.

## Installation

To use this program, ensure you have Rust installed on your system. If not, you can install it from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
